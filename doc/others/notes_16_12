# group 4
polling tasks with low priority
optimal order: class diagram -> task division -> flowcharts

# group 17
csv file - comma separated values???
!! **slide numbers**
figma - gui layout

# group 13
firebase - database tool
proto.io - gui layout
good web design
pipe????
faster task with higher priority
unexpected results for test cases
unexpected events/errors

# group 14
if the camera burns??
test peripherals connection??
board to interface with the sensors
who can sign up? how?
security -- allowed/not allowed new connection 
what happens after shutdown?

# group 4
dont use 0 interrupt priority (this will be shared with the Idle task, which is used to do nothing at all)

# group 8
reliable connectivity

# group 3
media pipe - ML
cloud database

# group 7
heroku - cloud
apache web server

# group 16
daemon for getting the data periodically from the sensors

# group 12
nginx - web server



## Improvements
+ define parking spots per local system
+ study cost vs number of parking sports detection
+ + data formats: app data format
+ **pcb** (power/interface board)
+ SW test cases
+ complete User layouts
+ signal handler -> timer handling of sampling periods
+ seta no diagrama de classess está ao contrário
+ !! ERROR HANDLING:: communication fails, check system status
  + tcp/ip fail: turn on the lamps associated with the gateway
  + lora fail: turn on each lamp
+ lora/spi/i2c SW stack
+ check all flowcharts
+ **wiring diagram of all modules**
+ better name for sensors tasks?? LampFailureDetector isr??
+ mechanical structure!!
+ security/safety on the system
+ Tools: Doxygen for project documentation
+ middleman (thread) to process sensors data??
+ PWM period, frequency??
