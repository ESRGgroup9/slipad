After all the necessary tools, packages and configurations are done, one needs to finally create the Linux custom image, that will run on the Raspberry Pi.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd ~/buildroot/buildroot-2021.02.5/
$ make
\end{lstlisting}

After that one can copy the image into the SD card, that will go into the Raspberry Pi. For that one can use the linux \verb|dd| command. \cite{dd}

\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo dd if=./output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb
\end{lstlisting}

With this command, one must define the input file, \verb|if|, which is the linux image, and the output file, \verb|of|, which is the SD card, being in this example named \verb|sdb|.
