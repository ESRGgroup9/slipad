- Market Definition

A remote control, by definition, is an electronic device used to operate another device from a distance, usually wirelessly. These allow you to control different types of devices, such as televisions, air conditioning, DVD players, sound systems, among others. Remote controllers have different technologies to communicate with the devices they control, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Radio Frequency and Infrared, the latter being the most used technology in remote controls.

There are three types of remotes:

- Dedicated Remote: a remote programmed to control one or more specific devices; 

- Universal Remote Control: also called a ‘library’ remote, it’s programmed by manufacture to control almost all common home devices;

- Programmable Remote Control: can be programmed either with codes to control devices or create more elaborate functions via a computer or mobile app, using USB communication, Bluetooth or Wifi.

Regarding the application field, since this allows the operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls, they may be used in different fields, like industry, civil, military, space, and others.
