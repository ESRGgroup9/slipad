ADDRESSING:
	Each end-device is identified by a 64-bit globally unique identifier,
DevEUI, that is assigned either by the manufacturer or the owner of the
end-device. Allocation of DevEUI identifiers require the assignor to have
an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) from the IEEE Registration
Authority.

SECURITY:
	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits and encrypts a block of elements (set of bits) at the same time, unlike stream ciphers that encode each single item individually.
