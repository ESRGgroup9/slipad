\section{Problem Statement}
Nowadays, the energy crisis is a constant theme because of the inflated energy prices. Furthermore, huge energy consumption is a burden to the environment, as not all means of energy production are non-polluting. It is known that, in cities, street lamps are continuously switched on, most of the time unnecessarily, which causes a great waste of energy, also contributing to the increase in light pollution.
	
With that in mind, the main objective of this project is the creation of a monitoring device capable of controlling intelligent street lamps, which turn on only when they detect movement in the surroundings, adjusting their luminosity according to the needs of the surrounding environment.
