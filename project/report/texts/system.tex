\subsection{System Overview}
Through the system overview diagram, in figure \ref{fig:system_overview}, it is possible to identify the main modules of the system to be developed, and how they interact. We can divide the system into two subsystems: the local system, which represents a lamp post, and the monitoring device, which can monitor a network of lamp posts.

The local system is composed of sensors, a controller and a lamp. Regarding the sensors, there will be a motion detector, to allow the detection of movement in the vicinity of the pole, and a light sensor, to detect the light conditions of the poleâ€™s surroundings. The controller, through sensors information, controls the luminosity of the lamp and communicates via wireless with the monitoring device. The monitoring device exchanges data with a database, recording all information relating to each local system. This information can also be viewed and managed by a mobile application, which can be accessed by a person responsible for the street lamp network. Knowing that the public lighting network is directly related to the electrical network, this will be used to power local systems, such as the monitoring device.
