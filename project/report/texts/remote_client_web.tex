\subsubsection*{Web Site}
\subparagraph*{Events}
In order to better understand the remote client web site, it is necessary to identify the events that may occur, presented in table \ref{table:rc_web_events}.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}
	{
		\begin{tabular}{|m{3cm}|m{5cm}|m{2.4cm}|m{2.4cm}|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Event} & \textbf{System Response} & \textbf{Source} & \textbf{Type}\\
			\hline\hline
			Insert location	& Show parking spots & User & Asynchronous\\
			\hline
			
			Obtain geolocation & Request device geolocation & Mobile Device & Asynchronous\\
			\hline
			
		\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subparagraph*{Use Cases}
The web site use cases diagram is shown in figure \ref{fig:UseCases_WebSite}. The main actors are a user, the database and a mobile device. In order to know if there are free parking spaces in a certain location, the user can enter a location (through the street name, for example) or, as in the application, use his mobile device to obtain the location automatically. The database lets the user know where there are empty parking spaces.

\subparagraph*{State Chart}
In figure \ref{fig:StateChart_WebSite}, one can see the web site state chart. The system initiates with the system configuration. Then the user can use his mobile phone's location (through the GPS tracking system) or type manually the location address. If the user enters the location manually (the street name, for example), it will be checked and, if valid, the free parking spaces will be displayed.

\subparagraph*{Sequence Diagram}
The sequence diagram of the web site is shown in the figure \ref{fig:SeqDiagram_WebSite}. To know where there are empty parking spots, the user can insert manually a location or use his \ac{gps} location. In both cases the web site asks the remote server (database) if there are available parking spots near the location and displays them to the user. However, in the case of using the \ac{gps} location, the web site has to get the \ac{gps} coordinates from the mobile device running the web site.
