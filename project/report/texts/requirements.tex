In order for the system to have the desired performance, these requirements and constraints must be respected:
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sensors data acquisition;                          
	\item Motion detection;
	\item Control of a street lamp;
	\item Control a network of street poles;
	\item Wireless communication between local systems and gateway;
	\item Manage street poles network information through a mobile application;
	\item Empty parking spots detection;
	\item Add lamppost location through a mobile application;
	\item Access available parking spots location through a web site.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User friendly mobile application and web site;
	\item Ambient luminosity sensing;
	\item Lower power consumption than actual street lights;
	\item Soft Real-Time Embedded System.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Buildroot
	\item C and C++ 
	\item Device Drivers
	\item Linux
	\item Raspberry Pi
	\item \ac{cps}
	\item Makefiles
	\item Pthreads
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Technical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
