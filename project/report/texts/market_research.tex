\section{Market Research}

\subsection{Market Definition}
Smart cities have the potential to benefit communities and individuals in a variety of applications across health, transportation, education, government, energy, and power and water. Implemented correctly, smart city applications can reduce costs, simplify services and offer a sustainable solution. \cite{smart_city_application_needs}

	\label{fig:smart_city_growth}
\end{figure}

As one can see, in figure \ref{fig:smart_city_growth}, according to MarketsandMarkets \cite{smart_cities_market} global smart cities market is expected to grow from USD 457 billion in 2021 to USD 873.7 billion by 2026, at a \ac{cagr} of 13.8\%, during the forecast period. Growing urbanization, need for efficient management and utilization of resources, demand for fast and efficient transport and commuting, public safety concerns, and increasing demand for a healthy environment with efficient energy consumption are expected to be the major factors driving the growth of the smart cities market.

As figure \ref{fig:smart_cities_sols} shows, there are various applications of \ac{iot} technology for smart cities. In this project there will be created a solution that comprises Smart Lighting management and Smart Parking.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Smart Lighting}
Smart Street lighting is a rapidly growing lighting market, with an expected \ac{cagr} of 20.4 \% until 2026 \cite{smart_light_market}, implementing a smart management of public lighting to optimize energy consumption according to lighting needs. This is boosted by regulatory policies that encourage energy efficiency, \ac{iot} convergence and the drop of \ac{led} prices. This new concept of smart light post is also growing, implementing not only the smart management of street lights, but also features that go from basic \ac{led} replacement control, to traffic and video monitoring, environmental monitoring, and others.

%Smart street lights represent a strategic infrastructure for smart city development, in particular, for video-surveillance services and autonomous driving.

\subsubsection{Telensa - PLANet}

Nowadays, Telensa is the market share leader in smart street lighting with more than ten years of experience.\cite{telensa} PLANet is an intelligent street lighting system, consisting of wireless nodes connecting individual lights, a dedicated network owned by the city and a central management application, seen in figure \ref{fig:telensa}. This system reduces energy and maintenance costs associated with street lighting and also improves quality of maintenance through automatic fault reporting.

%Doncaster, the largest metropolitan borough in England, houses over 45,000 smart Telensa streetlights, covering 220 square miles, achieving energy savings of approximately 1,5 million euros annually, with potential to increase this in the future.

%Telensa is also developing a new generation of light pole sensor devices featuring smartphone \ac{ai} technology, enabling detailed real-time insights on traffic mix, pedestrian movements and others.

\subsubsection{FLASHNET - inteliLIGHT}
FLASHNET is a company focused on developing intelligent systems for smarter cities and better infrastructures and have created a solution that provides the right amount of light where and when needed to lighten the streets, the inteliLIGHT \cite{inteli_light}.

Using the existing infrastructure, this solution saves money and transforms the existing distribution level network into an intelligent infrastructure of the future, as shown in figure \ref{fig:intelilight}. Furthermore, the system is integrated with major \ac{iot} platforms and provides \ac{api} connectivity with City Management applications, ensuring compatibility with existing smart lighting and smart city initiatives.

\subsection{Smart Parking}
Smart parking, through the monitoring of parking spaces availability in the city, is also a growing market, expected to grow with a \ac{cagr} of 17.85\% in he forecast period of 2021 to 2028.\cite{smart_parking_market} The rise in investment in building driverless vehicles and an increase in the governmentâ€™s initiative in building smart cities across the globe, along with the \ac{iot} technology demand and adoption, are the main driving factors for the growth of smart parking market.

\subsubsection{intuVision - intuVision VA Parking}
Regarding only to the detection of available parking spaces, there is a solution, by intuVision, named intuVision VA Parking, which provides parking lot analytics to determine vehicle count and security, and monitor parking space availability at all times, both for cities and for private parking lots, as one can see in the figure \ref{fig:intuvision}.\cite{parking}

\subsection{Why choose our product}
This product aims to decrease power consumption associated with the traditional street light network, and also, using that infrastructure, contribute to the development of a smart city, detecting available parking spaces in the streets. This street lighting solution can be used in residential areas, public spaces or a large outdoor parking lot, feasible of being installed in existent lamp posts, requiring minimum changes to the original infrastructure. Although in this project it is not implemented, aside the parking spaces availability detection, this product can have the ability to monitor and to process various areas of interest using the camera built in, like for example, security purposes.
