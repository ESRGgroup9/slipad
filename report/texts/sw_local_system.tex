%\subsection{Task Overview}
One can define and describe briefly how the local system is implemented, making use of threads and processes. As one can see in figure \ref{fig:task_overview}, this system is composed by two processes: the main process and a daemon, \textit{dSensors}, used to read the sensors \textit{LDR}, \textit{PIR} and \textit{LampFailureDetector}. The communication between the daemon and the main process is done via message queue and through the use of the signal \textit{SIGUSR1}, which the daemon can use to notify the main process of when there is a new message to read in the message queue.

In figure \ref{fig:csensors} is represented the class diagram of the local system's daemon. The class \textit{CSensors} is the main class of dSensors, which initializes all objects of each class listed bellow.

\myparagraph{Class CLoraComm}

In figure \ref{fig:LoraCommClass} is shown the \textit{CLoraComm} class diagram. This class defines an object \textit{CLoraComm}, with the address \textit{local\_addr}, capable of establishing a LoRa communication at a defined frequency \textit{freqMHz}, with the gateway which has the address \textit{dest\_addr}. This class inherits several methods from the class \textit{CCommunication}, represented with a lighter font and identified with '\^{}' at the begin of the method, which will be specified later.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

%*****************************
\clearpage
\myparagraph{Class CCommunication}

In figure \ref{fig:CCommunicationClass} is shown the \textit{CCommunication} class diagram. This class implements the structure for a communication class like \textit{CLoraComm} or \textit{CTCPclient}, which will be shown later. It implements a series of methods to send and receive messages. 

This class makes use of a thread, \textit{tSend}, to send messages in non-blocking mode. This thread is created with \textit{init(tprio)} method, which defines the thread priority and creates it. After creation, the thread goes to sleep, and is waken whenever the condition variable \textit{condtSend} is notified, which occurs when \textit{push(msg)} is used. This function adds the given message to a buffer, \textit{TxMsgs}, which is later sent in \textit{tSend}. This way, one has a waiting list of messages to be sent, in order to avoid the loss of a communication. The method \textit{send(msg)} sends a message in blocking mode; \textit{recv()} receives a message in non-blocking mode.

This class has two pure virtual functions: \textit{recvFunc} and \textit{sendFunc}, which must be implemented by the derived classes, since each communication protocol has its own functions to send and receive messages. Each communication has a state, \textit{status}, defined by the enumeration connection status, \textit{ConnStatus}.

\myparagraph{Class CLamp}

In figure \ref{fig:classlamp} is shown the \textit{CLamp} class diagram, which defines a \textit{CLamp} object. When creating the object, using the constructor \textit{CLamp()}, one can define how much time the lamp stays at maximum brightness, passing this time to the constructor through parameter, \textit{timeoutSecs}, in seconds, being defined into \textit{LampOnTimeoutSecs}.
One can interact with the object \textit{CLamp} by changing the brightness, through the method \textit{setBrightness(lux)}, where \textit{lux} is a value from 0, where the lamp is OFF, to 100, where the lamp is at maximum brightness.  Internally, this class uses a mutex, \textit{mutChangePWM} to protect the PWM value when using \textit{setBrightness} method.

\myparagraph{Class CPir}

In figure \ref{fig:classpir} is shown the \textit{CPir} class. When movement is detected in the surrounding area of the lamppost, the sensor puts the high digital value in its output, triggering an interrupt service routine. When creating a object \textit{CPir}, one can define the ISR to be executed, passing to the constructor a function pointer, \textit{pirISR}. This class also has methods to enable and disable the respective ISR.

\myparagraph{Class CCamera}

In figure \ref{fig:classcamera} is shown the \textit{CCamera} class diagram, that defines a camera object.  This class implements the control of a camera device, with filename \textit{camFilename}, through the basic functions \textit{open()}, \textit{close()} and \textit{capture()}, the latter used to get an image frame from the camera.

\myparagraph{Class CParkDetection}

In figure \ref{fig:classcamera} is shown the \textit{CParkDetection} class diagram, that implements the tools needed to do process camera frames in order to do parking detection. Before determining if there are parking spots available, one needs to extract the park outline from the camera frame, using \textit{getOutline(frame)}. This method stores in the variable \textit{parkCoords} the coordinates on the image frame relating to the park outline. After this, one can calculate the number of vacants inside that park outline, through \textit{calcVacants(frame)}.

\clearpage
\myparagraph{Class CLdr}

In figure \ref{fig:classldr} is shown the \textit{CLdr} class, that defines the functions to interact with the LDR sensor. This contains an enumeration for the luminosity states, \textit{LuxState}, which can be \textit{DAY}, \textit{NIGHT} or \textit{UNDEF} as undefined, used for initialization. The luminosity state can be obtain by the use of \textit{getLuxState()}.

%*****************************
\myparagraph{Class CFailureDetector}

In figure \ref{fig:classfail} is shown the Failure Detector class, which is similar to the \textit{CPir}. When creating an instance of this class, using the constructor \textit{CFailureDetector}, one can pass to the constructor a pointer to the ISR that will be triggered each time the failure detector senses that the lamp is off. Since one can verify if the lamp is broken only at night, that is when the lamp is turned on at minimum or maximum bright, one should \textit{enable} this detector only when during the night.

\subsection{Task Overview}

One can list the tasks that compose the main process:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{CLoraComm::tSend:} sends a message to the gateway, using the LoRa module;
	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::tParkDetection:} determines parking outline; acquire a camera frame, process it by verifying parking spots availability;
	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::tLoraRecv:} receives a message from the gateway, using the LoRa module;
	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::tRecvSensor:} receives messages sent by the daemon, via message queue, regarding sensors information. It's awaken by the use of signal \textit{SIGUSR1}, sent by the daemon when there is a message to read.
\end{itemize}

Bellow are listed the tasks that compose the daemon, \textit{dSensors}. As stated above, in \textit{tRecvSensor}, whenever one of the following tasks sends a command to the main process, it is done by message queue, and also, a signal is used, \textit{SIGUSR1}, to alert the main process that a new message was sent.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CSensors::tReadLdr:} periodically reads the LDR sensor; if a change in luminosity state is detected (\textit{DAY} to \textit{NIGHT}, or vice-versa) a command is sent to the main process;
	\item \textbf{CSensors::lampfISR:} ISR for the lamp failure detector; this is enabled only during the night, and is executed when the failure detector detects that the lamp is off, sending a command to the main process;
	\item \textbf{CSensors::PirISR:} ISR for the PIR sensor; this is enable only during the night and is executed when motion is detected, sending a command to the main process. 
\end{itemize}

%**********************************************************

\subsection{Task Priority}

One needs to assign each thread a static priority level to indicate their relative urgency. Moreover, the scheduler will always pick the thread that is ready to execute with the highest priority level. Priorities must be assigned in order to ensure efficiency and execute real-time tasks.

With that in mind, the priority assignment diagram for the local system's main process is represented in figure \ref{fig:lst_priority}, as well as for the daemon, in figure \ref{fig:lsdaemont_priority}.

\end{figure}

%**********************************************************
\clearpage
\subsection{Task Synchronization}
Real-time tasks share resources and services, and as such, should be prepared to await for the availability of these resources and services, like logical resources (buffers and data), physical resources, services like directory services, etc. In order to have coordinate access to shared resources and avoid race conditions, the kernel has resources that provide synchronization tools. 

\myparagraph{Condition Variables}

A condition variable is a task synchronization tool that can be used to block (wait) one or more threads, suspending its execution. The blocked threads are awakened when the condition variable is notified. 

The condition variables used in the main process are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::condRecvSensors:} notifies \textit{tRecvSensors} that a new message is available on the message queue, \textit{msgqSensors};

	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::condCamFrame:} notifies \textit{tParkDetection} to acquire a new camera frame and process it;

	\item \textbf{CCommunication::condtSend:} used to notify \textit{CCommunication::tSend} that a new message is ready to be sent.
\end{itemize}

The condition variables used in the daemon are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CSensors::condReadLdr:} notifies \textit{tReadLdr} to acquire values from LDR sensor and process them;
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Mutexes}

A mutex is a locking mechanism that provides mutual exclusion, supporting ownership and other protocols. A mutex is initially created in the unlocked state in which it can be acquired by a task. After being acquired, the mutex moves to the locked state. When the task releases the mutex, it returns to the unlocked state.

\clearpage
The mutexes used in the main process are listed bellow.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::mutRecvSensors:} mutex associated with the condition variable \textit{condRecvSensors} to read a new message from the sensors message queue;

	\item \textbf{CLocalSystem::mutCamFrame:} mutex associated with the condition variable \textit{condCamFrame} to acquire a camera frame;

	\item \textbf{CCommunication::mutComms:} indirectly used by \textit{CLoraComms}, to protect communication usage of send and receive functions;

	\item \textbf{CCommunication::mutTxMsgs:} indirectly used by \textit{CLoraComms}; used to protect the insertion and removal of messages into \textit{TxMsgs};

	\item \textbf{CLamp::mutChangePWM:} protects the modification of PWM when defining a new PWM value for the lamp.
\end{itemize}

The mutexes used in the daemon are listed bellow.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CSensors::mutReadLdr:} protects reading of LDR sensor;
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Signals}

A signal is a notification to a process that an event has occurred. Signals are sometimes described as software interrupts, being analogous to hardware interrupts in that they interrupt the normal flow of execution of a program. One process can send a signal to another process, being in that way, employed as a synchronization technique.

The signals used between the main process and the daemon are listed bellow.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{SIGUSR1:}	signal sent by \textit{dSensors} to the main process, whenever a new message is inserted in the message queue, \textit{msgqSensors}. This is received in the main process in a signal handler, that will wake up the task \textit{tRecvSensors}, through the condition variable \textit{condRecvSensors}.
\end{itemize}

%**********************************************************
\subsection{Task Communication}
\myparagraph{Message Queue}

A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. A message queue, \textit{msgqSensors}, will be used to communicate between the main process and the \textit{dSensors}. In that way, the main process is agnostic to the cyclic reading necessary for the sensor \textit{ldr} and for the interrupts generated by the \textit{pir} and \textit{lampf}, being only informed when necessary, through the message queue.

%**********************************************************

The start-up for the main process is shown in figure \ref{fig:mainprocess}. Firstly, a \textit{CLocalSystem} object is created, initializing all objects, that will be detailed later. After that, \textit{run()} method from \textit{CLocalSystem} is used, which will wait for the termination of all tasks.

After that, a message queue is opened in order to communicate with the main process. Then, it will wait until it receives a message in the message queue, that will be the main process PID. After this setups, a \textit{CSensors} object is created, and the \textit{run()} method is used, working similarly to the one presented in the main process start-up process.

\subsection{Device Driver}
In this project it will be implemented a device driver for a GPIO pin, used to read from the sensors PIR and LampFailureDetector.

First, one has to see what are registers that the board uses, relating to GPIO pins. In the Raspberry Pi 4B documentation, \cite{rpi_datasheet}, one finds the registers easily for the GPIO pins that needs to be used for implementing the interface. The BCM2711 chip has 58 GPIO lines, split into three banks. Bank 0 is the one mapped on the header pins, from GPIO 0 to GPIO 27. Also, the GPIO registers base address is the 0x7E200000 and the address used is 32-bits.

To configure a pin as output or input, or to set or reset its value, the registers presented in table \ref{table:gpio_reg} are used.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}
	{
		\begin{tabular}{|m{2,5cm}|m{2,7cm}|m{6,8cm}|m{1,6cm}|}

			\\\hline			
		\end{tabular}
	}
	\caption{Raspberry Pi Registers used for GPIO configuration.}
	\label{table:gpio_reg}
\end{table}

The \textit{GPFSELx} register is used to define the operation of the GPIO pins, input or output. The \textit{GPFSETx} / \textit{GPFCLRx} are registers used to set or clear pins, respectively. Each register \textit{GPFSELx} contains 10 GPIOs.

As defined in the Hardware Specification section, PIR sensor will have its output connected to the pin 27 of the Raspberry Pi, as the Lamp Failure Detector will have its output connected to the pin 22. Therefore, the register to define both pins as input is \textit{GPFSEL2}.
